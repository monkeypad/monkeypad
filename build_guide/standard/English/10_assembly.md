### 10-1. Assembly of the Main Board

![Main Board Assembly](../images/10/monkeypad_10_01.jpeg)

Since the design is fully symmetrical and reversible, decide whether to have the aluminum side of the top plate face outward or the white & logo side face outward.

*Note:* The aluminum side does not have any surface coating and is prone to scratches. If necessary, apply a coating. We also provide spare parts for replacements.

![Top Plate Orientation](../images/10/monkeypad_10_02.jpeg)

The photo shows an example of assembling with the white side facing outward.

Attach the [22] **Torque Hinges** to the main body using [41] **M3 Hex Nuts** inserted into the opposite nut pockets, and temporarily secure them with [38] **M3 x 12mm Low-Profile Screws**.

![Securing Torque Hinges](../images/10/monkeypad_10_04.jpeg)

Insert **5** [36] **Hex Double Male Threaded Standoffs** into the pockets as shown in the photo. Attach the [6] **Main Top Plate** using [37] **M3 x 6mm Low-Profile Screws**.

Attach the side with the ribs to the top plate side. Secure the top plate and main PCB by sandwiching the ribs.

Secure the main PCB using [39] **M2 x 8mm Screws** and **Nuts**.

Attach the [7] **Main Bottom Plate** using [37] **M3 x 6mm Low-Profile Screws**.

The torque hinges are adjustable in hardness. Adjust the tightness of the hex nuts using a wrench to change the hardness. Do not overtighten.

### 10-2. Attaching the Tripod Adapter

![](../images/10/monkeypad_10_10.jpeg)

Secure the [46] Tripod Adapters to the sub-board's bottom plate using [40] M3 x 6mm Low-Profile Screws** and [41] M3 Nuts. Alternatively, you can attach [45] Grommets instead of Tripod Adapters. Use whichever you prefer.

**If attaching the Tripod Adapter:**

### 10-3. Assembling the Sub-Board

#### [If attaching low-profile sockets to the sub-board, click here](../low_profile/10_Assembly_Low_Profile.md)

Secure the [11] Sub Body and [8] Sub Top Plate. Insert 5 Hex Double Male Threaded Standoffs into the sub body's pockets and attach the top plate using [37] M3 x 6mm Low-Profile Screws. Attach the side with ribs to the top plate side as shown in the photo.

![Assembling Sub-Board](../images/10/monkeypad_10_14.jpeg)

Secure the sub-board PCB using [39] M2 Screws and [42] M2 Nuts at 4 locations.

![Securing Sub-Board PCB](../images/10/monkeypad_10_15.jpeg)

Ensure that the legs of the IO Expander, Jacks, and Connectors on the PCB do not touch the top plate by trimming any excess length with wire cutters.

*(Contact may alter resistance values, potentially causing malfunctions.)*

Attach the [9] Sub Bottom Plate to the Sub Body using [6] M3 x 6mm Low-Profile Screws.

Finally, secure the torque hinges. Insert [38] **M3 x 12mm Low-Profile Screws** under the nut pockets and secure them.

![Securing Torque Hinges](../images/10/monkeypad_10_16.jpeg)

![Securing Torque Hinges](../images/10/monkeypad_10_17.jpeg)

Adjust the position and hardness of the torque hinges to ensure they do not collide when moved at 90 degrees.

Assemble the other side in the same way.

### 10-4. Attaching the Rubber Pads

Attach the [44] Rubber Pads at the following positions to complete the assembly.

![Attaching Rubber Pads](../images/10/monkeypad_10_19.jpeg)

Attach your preferred key switches and keycaps.

**Good job!**
